==================
Under-neith It All
==================

Installs will eventually be done by a simplified installer in

	/bin/bash ./bin/install

Neith
=====

This will be a command and control engine utilizing python.  It will be used to interface several language for learning purposes in order to better master the various paradigms used in common scenarios.  From there, it will interface command modules with clients and allow for content flow between two systems based on a permission set advocated to the client.


More to come!

Plans for the future

* client signatures
* PyDoc and PyPI configurations
* File listener
* Port listener
* Extendable command options
* Client lock down
* Key distribution and localization
* Encrypted traffic on both ends

Plans for utilization
_____________________

1) Maintaining contact with all owned devices in order to establish coordinated rules and effects based on state changes int he device
2) Allowing for commands to be sent from non local devices based on authentication measures executed by Neith
3) Providing a transportable communication layer that can be interacted with via a multitude of platforms and languages
