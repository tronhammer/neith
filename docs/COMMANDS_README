Custom and Third Party Commands
===============================

The commands directory is a repository of custom and third party Commands  
that the Neith Loom can import and utilize during run time.

These same Commands will also be availabe during the Client creation process 
and can be selected and packaged individually as Destiny objects into a 
Pharaoh or Deity Client for distribution to other devices.
