Pharaoh Clients
=============

This is where Pharaoh Clients will live. Pharaohs have a session token and 
will have the ability to execute Commands on the Neith Loom server depending 
on the permission set and Commands available to the Deity. 

Depending on the platforms requested during creation with the bin/create_pharaoh 
command, there will be a listing of various platform types with deity files 
located inside, like so::

	$: tree neith/clients/pharaohs/
	
	neith/clients/pharaohs/
	├── README -> PHAROAHS_README
	└── python
	    └── Raspberry_PI.py
